Nest Demo Application

Example by Eugene Kislyy

"Thermostat control panel"

You can change low, hight, target themperatures (C) of thermostate, and on/off security mode

"Security mode off" means that thermostates are off when smoke protection in alarm or warning state, and continue working after smoke protection returns to normal state (to prevent fire expansion)
